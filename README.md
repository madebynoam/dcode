# Claude Skills for Designers

**A toolkit for designers who work in code but don't live there.**

Most Claude Code skills assume you're a developer. These skills are different—they're designed for the designer's journey through a codebase: finding components, understanding design systems, making safe visual changes, and prototyping in real code without fear.

## Why This Exists

Designers increasingly need to work directly in code, but codebases are intimidating. These skills bridge the gap between "I have Figma" and "I need to ship this."

**Built for designers who:**
- Want to find where a component lives without grep wizardry
- Need to make a CSS tweak without breaking production
- Prototype new screens following existing patterns
- Audit design consistency across a codebase
- Feel confident navigating code, not just reading it

## About

Created by [Noam Almosnino](https://noamalmos.com), a designer at Automattic exploring how AI tools can make codebases more accessible to designers.
